## Introduction 

The financial market is a strange place. We have seen Warren Buffett, Ray Dalio, Charlie Munger - the very very best who have had billions of dollars. Others, 95% of the population, lose the money instead. 

So, how are the best of the best pick its stocks? It is from the fundamental, the technical side or the sentimental side? Within this paper, we hope to bring another perspective, using machine learning models to predict the profitability of the stock price. 

### Outline of the paper 

We list all of the variables in our dataset below. There is also a data visualization section where we show the distribution of each variable. After exploring the data, we start to process the data. To find the best model, we choose to explore three machine learning models which are Lasso, Random forest and KNN. And then, we use model stacking technique to create a new model by combining all the three models mentioned earlier. Lastly, we will make a conclusion based on the results obtained from these models. 

## List of Variables 

For the dataset, we includes financial information on companies in the S&P 500 stock index from 1999-2021. This information was scraped from Yahoo Finance in November of 2021, and collected in a csv format for data analysis. The information includes metrics like sales, earnings, cogs, stock price, and market sector as well as macroeconomic data such as GDP or Money Supply. The goal is to analyze and model this data to better improve projections for a company’s future profitability. The variables in the data set are described below:
